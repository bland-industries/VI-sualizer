About:
This is a VI style editor I created for a class. The class was CIS 163 Computer Science 2 at Grand Valley State University. This assignment was to use a linked list to create a text editor and be able to move and manipulate lines of text.

About the Author:
At the time of creating this program I had two semesters of Java programming. I have had no other training in programming in any language. I received a 100% on the assignment, not to brag or anything.

Instructions:
The main thing to look at is the help section. When you opened the program type h and hit enter. This will give you all the commands possible in the program. You can not string commands together. One command and then enter. Other then that it is really boring.
